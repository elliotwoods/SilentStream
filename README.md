# SilentStream
Low-latency multi-peer audio streaming for silent discos using WebRTC

# Usage

```
npm install
npm start
```

If you have trouble then try:

1. Open the folder in VS Code
2. Run app.js
3. See what's up

Note : if you're playing sound from the same computer that's doing the streaming, then you'll need some kind of audio loopback device. e.g.:

* For OSX you could use BlackHole https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole
* For Windows you could use LoopBeAudio https://www.nerds.de/en/loopbeaudio.html (although I'm sure there are free things out there also)
